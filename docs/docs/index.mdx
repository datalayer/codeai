# ✨ Code AI

**Code AI** is an AI-powered CLI agent for data analysis that interacts with [Agent Runtimes](https://github.com/datalayer/codeai) via the AG-UI and ACP protocols.

Built on [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev), it provides an interactive terminal experience for code analysis, Jupyter notebooks, and data science workflows — all from your terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install codeai
codeai
```

This starts an interactive session with a background codeai server and the default agent spec. See the [CLI](./cli/) page for all options.

## Features

- **Interactive TUX** — Claude Code-inspired terminal interface with Rich rendering, slash commands, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Agent Specs** — launch preconfigured agents from the [agentspecs catalogue](https://github.com/datalayer/agentspecs) with `--agentspec-id` or pick one interactively
- **MCP Tools** — agents can use MCP servers (search, file access, APIs) as tools
- **Codemode** — MCP tools are exposed as programmatic tools the LLM can compose into code
- **Streaming** — real-time response streaming with tool call visualization
- **AG-UI & ACP** — connect to local or remote agent servers via HTTP/SSE or WebSocket
- **Context Tracking** — visualize token usage, export conversation context
